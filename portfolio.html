                <h2>How do I approach things?</h2>
            <p> The four essays which are here collected will be of interest to a wide circle of educated people, but
                they can
                only be thoroughly understood and judged by those who are really acquainted with psychoanalysis as such.
                It is
                hoped that they may serve as a bond between students of ethnology, philology, folklore and of the allied
                sciences, and psychoanalysts; they cannot, however, supply both groups the entire requisites for such
                co-operation. They will not furnish the former with sufficient insight into the new psychological
                technique, nor
                will the psychoanalysts acquire through them an adequate command over the material to be elaborated.
                Both groups
                will have to content themselves with whatever attention they can stimulate here and there and with the
                hope that
                frequent meetings between them will not remain unproductive for science.</p>
